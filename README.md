## Professional Summary

Senior financial systems manager with a background that blends finance, AI adoption, technical skills, and collaborative leadership. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the chance to leverage various technologies, including advanced applications (NetSuite, Salesforce, Concur, Snowflake), integration platforms (Boomi, Celigo), and technical tools (SuiteScript, Python, SQL, Power BI).

## Featured Code: 


**The code provided below is my original work and has been reviewed to ensure all sensitive information and proprietary content have been removed.**


**SuiteScript - Client Side - Dynamic List Select**

**File**: [`dynamic_list_select.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/dynamic_list_select.js)

This client side script allows the user to select given fields from a drop down list based on a parent field.

**SuiteScript - User Event - Tax Calculations in NetSuite**

**File**: [`disable_tax_calculations.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/disable_tax_calculations.js)

This User Event script runs when tax calculation is enabled on transactions by setting a custom field based on whether the record is new, the posting period is open, or key values like total amount or taxability have changed. It reduces manual intervention and improves financial accuracy by enforcing consistent tax logic and logging the decision process for auditability.

**SuiteScript - Scheduled - Monthly Subsidiary Sync**

**File**: [`exit_workflow.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/exit_workflow.js)

This User Event Script automates the order-to-cash process when a sales order is created and marked with a specific trigger value. It automatically creates an item fulfillment, generates an invoice, and applies a customer paymentâ€”all while handling subsidiary-specific settings and fallback logicâ€”then updates the sales order to reflect completion.

**SuiteScript - Scheduled - Monthly Subsidiary Sync**

**File**: [`monthy_sub_sync.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/monthy_sub_sync.js)

Created a NetSuite Scheduled Script that runs monthly to automatically update customer records with newly added subsidiaries, ensuring consistent data and preventing synchronization errors. Leveraged SuiteScript 2.0 search functionality to identify subsidiaries flagged for updates and systematically applied changes across customer records. 

---

**SuiteScript - RESTlet - Saved Search Aggrigation (To be called by a Python script)**

**File**: [`search_restlet.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/search_restlet.js)

This NetSuite RESTlet efficiently retrieves and transforms complex financial data by dynamically executing a predefined saved search and aggregating the results into a structured JSON format. By implementing error handling and pagination, it ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with external systems or reporting tools.

---

**SQL - Recreate NetSuite Balance Sheet** 

**File**: [`balance_sheet_recreate.sql`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/sql/balance_sheet.sql)

This stored procedure (USP_BALANCESHEET) generates a consolidated balance sheet by aggregating NetSuite financial data, applying currency conversions, and handling special account logic like retained earnings and net income using CTEs and unions. It overcomes NetSuite's reporting limitationsâ€”especially for India subsidiaries with April fiscal year startsâ€”by integrating with Power BI for accessible and accurate financial reporting.

---
**SQL - Salesforce Billing Sub Invoice Line Fix** 

**File**: [`sub_invoice_lines.sql`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/sql/sub_invoice_lines.sql)

This script implements a stored procedure that creates and populates tables to reconcile invoice line data from Salesforce and NetSuite. It extracts, transforms, and merges raw data from both systems, updating fields like invoice amounts, tax details, and statuses to fix discrepancies. The unified reporting table generated by the script improves data accuracy and addresses sub invoice line issues between one of the most complex integrations in the Order to Cash world.

---

**Python - NetSuite Data Extraction for Reporting**

**File**: [`netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/python/netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py)

One recent contributions includes the development of a highly optimized python script used to streamline and automate tax reporting and team processes. I leveraged NetSuite **RESTlets** to gather real time data from NetSuite necessary for this project. 

This project automates data extraction from NetSuite using OAuth-authenticated REST APIs, transforms and analyzes the retrieved financial data using Pandas and SQL queries, and systematically generates Excel and CSV reports. It includes detailed exception handling and data validation, ensuring accurate reporting for investment portfolios and tax documentation.

I've been investigating the optimimal way to present this data. I'm stuck between Streamlit and Django. Would love to hear your thoughts!

**Python - Mass PDF Encryption**

**File**: [`pdf_encryption.py`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/python/encryption.py)

This Python script automates the secure handling of PDF documents. Specifically, it processes zipped folders containing multiple PDFs, decrypts and re-encrypts each PDF using individualized passwords sourced from an Excel spreadsheet, and renames the files accordingly for clarity and organization. The script leverages pandas for Excel file handling, PyPDF2 for PDF manipulation, and standard Python libraries for file management. It's particularly designed to preserve data integrity, manage sensitive information securely, and facilitate efficient bulk processing in document-heavy workflows.

## About Nick: Data, Finance, and Life in the Seacoast

As a retired college soccer player, I love to put on the cleats and run around once a week playing men's league. To try to stay in shape, I spend most weekends hiking the mountains or running the coastline of my home state, New Hampshire. My golden retriever, Breaker, also loves to get me outside and on the trails. Of course, I love spending quality time with family and friends, and I'm always eager to chat about cars. I'm also excited to be getting married soon!
