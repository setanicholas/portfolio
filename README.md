## 💻 Featured Code: 

**Recreated NetSuite Balance Sheet Leveraging Data Warehouse** 

**File**: [`Balance_Sheet.sql`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/sql/BALANCE_SHEET.sql)

The provided stored procedure (USP_BALANCESHEET) automates the creation of a comprehensive balance sheet summary by aggregating and standardizing financial data from NetSuite tables, including handling currency conversions and specific account types such as retained earnings. It calculates net income and retained earnings separately, integrating results through union operations to support detailed financial analysis across subsidiaries and fiscal periods. Additionally, it utilizes a JavaScript function (GetFiscalYear) to accurately determine fiscal years beginning in April, making it ideal for managing global financial portfolios within ERP systems.

**NetSuite Data Extraction Reporting**

One recent contributions includes the development of a highly optimized python script for **Tax Reporting** used to streamline and automate reporting and team processes. I leveraged NetSuite RESTLets to gather real time data from NetSuite necessary for this project. 

**File**: [`netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/python/netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py)

This project automates data extraction from NetSuite using OAuth-authenticated REST APIs, transforms and analyzes the retrieved financial data using Pandas and SQL queries, and systematically generates Excel and CSV reports. It includes detailed exception handling and data validation, ensuring accurate reporting for investment portfolios and K-1 tax documentation.
