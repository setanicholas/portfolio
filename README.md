**SuiteScript - User Event - Tax Calculations in NetSuite**

**File**: [`disable_tax_calculations.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/disable_tax_calculations.js)

This NetSuite User Event script automatically controls the activation of tax calculations on records based on creation status, field changes, and posting period conditions. Its value lies in streamlining tax processing, reducing manual effort, preventing calculation errors, and enhancing compliance and auditability through clear logging and automation.

This NetSuite User Event script automates control of tax calculation on records by setting a custom field (custbody_ava_disable_tax_calculation) based on specific business logic. When a record is newly created, it allows tax calculation by default. For edited records, the script checks if the posting period is open, and whether relevant fields (total amount or istaxable status) have changed; if so, it enables tax calculation. Detailed debug logs throughout provide transparency into its decision-making, ensuring accuracy and traceability in financial processing.

**SuiteScript - Scheduled - Monthly Subsidiary Sync**

**File**: [`monthy_sub_sync.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/monthy_sub_sync.js.js)

Created a NetSuite Scheduled Script that runs monthly to automatically update customer records with newly added subsidiaries, ensuring consistent data and preventing synchronization errors. Leveraged SuiteScript 2.0 search functionality to identify subsidiaries flagged for updates and systematically applied changes across customer records.

**SuiteScript - RESTlet - Saved Search Aggrigation (To be called by a Python script)**

**File**: [`search_restlet.js`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/suitescript/search_restlet.js)

This NetSuite RESTlet efficiently retrieves and transforms complex financial data by dynamically executing a predefined saved search and aggregating the results into a structured JSON format. By implementing error handling and pagination, it ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with external systems or reporting tools.

---

**SQL - Recreate NetSuite Balance Sheet** 

**File**: [`balance_sheet_recreate.sql`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/sql/BALANCE_SHEET.sql)

The provided **stored procedure** (USP_BALANCESHEET) automates the creation of a comprehensive balance sheet summary by aggregating and standardizing financial data from NetSuite tables, including handling currency conversions and specific account types such as retained earnings. It calculates net income and retained earnings separately, integrating results through union operations to support detailed financial analysis across subsidiaries and fiscal periods. Additionally, it utilizes a **JavaScript** function (GetFiscalYear) to accurately determine fiscal years beginning in April, making it ideal for managing global financial portfolios within ERP systems.

**SQL - Salesforce Billing Sub Invoice Line Fix** 

**File**: [`sub_invoice_lines.sql`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/sql/sub_invoice_lines.sql)

This script implements a stored procedure that creates and populates tables to reconcile invoice line data from Salesforce and NetSuite. It extracts, transforms, and merges raw data from both systems, updating fields like invoice amounts, tax details, and statuses to fix discrepancies. The unified reporting table generated by the script improves data accuracy and addresses sub invoice line issues between one of the most complex integrations in the Order to Cash world.

**Python - NetSuite Data Extraction for Reporting**

**File**: [`netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/python/netsuite_data_extraction_reporting.py)

One recent contributions includes the development of a highly optimized python script used to streamline and automate tax reporting and team processes. I leveraged NetSuite **RESTlets** to gather real time data from NetSuite necessary for this project. 

This project automates data extraction from NetSuite using OAuth-authenticated REST APIs, transforms and analyzes the retrieved financial data using Pandas and SQL queries, and systematically generates Excel and CSV reports. It includes detailed exception handling and data validation, ensuring accurate reporting for investment portfolios and tax documentation.

I've been investigating the optimimal way to present this data. I'm stuck between Streamlit and Django. Would love to hear your thoughts!

**Python - Mass PDF Encryption**

**File**: [`pdf_encryption.py`](https://github.com/setanicholas/portfolio/blob/main/assets/python/encryption.py)

This Python script automates the secure handling of PDF documents. Specifically, it processes zipped folders containing multiple PDFs, decrypts and re-encrypts each PDF using individualized passwords sourced from an Excel spreadsheet, and renames the files accordingly for clarity and organization. The script leverages pandas for Excel file handling, PyPDF2 for PDF manipulation, and standard Python libraries for file management. It's particularly designed to preserve data integrity, manage sensitive information securely, and facilitate efficient bulk processing in document-heavy workflows.
